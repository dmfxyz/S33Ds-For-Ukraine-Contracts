# Bubki for Ukraine NFT Project

This is the smart contract repository for Bubki for Ukraine.

The project requires [Forge](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) for its build system.

Once you've installed forge (`foundryup --version nightly` recommended way to install), you can build and test the contracts using `forge build` and `forge test` respectively.
